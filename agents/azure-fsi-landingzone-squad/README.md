# Azure FSI Landing Zone Agent

An AI-powered deployment agent for Azure Financial Services Industry (FSI) Landing Zones.

## Overview

This agent helps deploy secure, compliant Azure infrastructure for financial services using Microsoft FSI Landing Zone templates, Azure Verified Modules (AVM), and European compliance policies.

**Two modes available:**
- **Solo Mode** (default): Fast template generation and simple deployments
- **Squad Mode** (`--squad`): Multi-agent collaboration with specialist expertise

## Quick Start

### Solo Mode (Default)
```bash
cd agents/azure-fsi-landingzone
python agent.py
```

Example prompts:
- "Generate Ring 0 foundation templates for FSI Landing Zone"
- "Create a hub VNet with Azure Firewall"
- "List available deployment rings"

### Squad Mode (Multi-Agent)
```bash
cd agents/azure-fsi-landingzone
python agent.py --squad
```

Example prompts:
- "Review my entire FSI Landing Zone deployment for production readiness"
- "Analyze security posture for Ring 0 foundation"
- "Detect drift between local templates and deployed Azure resources"
- "Generate comprehensive compliance report"

## Choosing the Right Mode

### ✅ Use **Solo Mode** when:
- You need quick template generation
- Your task is simple and focused
- You're getting started with FSI Landing Zones
- You prefer simplicity and lower cost

### ✅ Use **Squad Mode** when:
- You need comprehensive security/compliance review
- You want expert analysis across multiple domains
- You need drift detection between local templates and deployed infrastructure
- You're preparing for production deployment or audit
- You want parallel analysis for faster results on complex tasks
- You need cross-domain insights (security + network + DevOps)

## Squad Mode Features

When running with `--squad`, you get access to specialist sub-agents:

- 🏗️ **Architect Agent**: Holistic design and architectural recommendations
- 🚀 **DevOps Agent**: CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- 🔒 **Security Agent**: Security posture and compliance analysis
- 🌐 **Network Agent**: Network design and connectivity review

### How Squad Mode Works

The orchestrator agent coordinates specialist agents to provide multi-dimensional analysis:
